# == Synopsis
#
# This class represents a reference to an object in the R interpreter. It
# also holds a conversion mode used if the RObj represents a callable function.
# RObj objects can be passed to R functions called from Ruby and are the
# default return type if RSRuby cannot convert the returned results of an R
# function.

require 'rsruby'

# == Synopsis
#
# This is an extended RObj class inspired by the example given in the RPy
# manual. Methods caught by method_missing are converted into attribute calls
# on the R object it represents. Also to_s is redefined to print exactly the
# representation used in R.
#
# == Usage
#
# See examples/erobj.rb[link:files/examples/erobj_rb.html] for examples of
# usage.

require 'rsruby/erobj'

# == Synopsis
#
# This is an extended ERObj class inspired by the example given in the RPy
# manual used for R data frames.
# As with ERObj, methods caught by method_missing are converted into attribute
# calls on the R dataframe it represents. The rows and columns methods give
# access to the column and row names.
#
# == Usage
#
# See examples/dataframe.rb[link:files/examples/dataframe_rb.html] for
# examples of usage.
